Design a simple backend API endpoint for user registration. The endpoint should:


1. Accept a POST request with a JSON body containing username, email, and password.
2. Validate the input (e.g., email format, password length, record duplicacy).
3. Hash the password securely.
4. Save the user to a JSON database (JSON file).
5. Return a success response (e.g., user ID and message).


Acceptance Criteria:

The candidate is asked to create a basic signup system. 
It should take a username, email, and password; check if everything is valid; 
Safely protect the password; save the user info in a file; and return a success message with the user ID. If these steps are working, the assignment is correct.



Submission Process:

Create a Github repository with public access.Push the codes to this newly created Github repo and share the repo URL over email to (akash@growhut.in, hr@growhut.in)
